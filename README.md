# Simulation

While I'm not quite sure how this skill will be relevant, I find the idea so
compelling. As generators of artifical data, they decorate at least some of
that otherwise inexplicable space between empiricism and theory.

This repository contains: 

- An agent-based physics simulation of **heat dispersion** in a metal rod, with
  "animations".
- An incomplete economic simulation in an attempt to do something like an A/B
  test on two theories to account for some curious macroeconomic phenomena.
